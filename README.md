# Learn XQuery: A list of great articles, blog posts, and books for learning XQuery

Let's show the world how to learn XQuery. Pull requests welcome. Quality over comprehensiveness - just the best, most helpful resources, please. Talk about [`#xquery`](https://twitter.com/search?q=xquery) on Twitter.

Also, check out these [resources powered by XQuery](https://github.com/joewiz/xquerypower), [repositories with XQuery on GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3AXQuery&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), and [questions about XQuery on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xquery).

## Gentle introductions

- [W3Schools XQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/xquery/). Limited to XQuery 1.0, but a quick overview.
- [XQuery Wikibook Beginning Examples](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery#Beginning_Examples). Perhaps the best developed portion of the XQuery Wikibook site (see remarks below).

## Materials from XQuery courses

- [XQuery for Humanists](https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/XQuery4Humanists), by Clifford Anderson, et al. Exercises for XQuery workshops given at conferences geared toward academics and other practitioners in the humanities.
- [Make *your* edition: models and methods for digital textual scholarship](https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/), a.k.a. Pittsburgh NEH Institute, hosted at the University of Pittsburgh in 2017. Covers many topics, including XPath and XQuery.
- [Digital Humanities Courses](http://newtfire.org/dh/), by Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar. Covers many topics, including XPath and XQuery.
- [XQuery Summer Institute](http://xqueryinstitute.org/), hosted at Vanderbilt University in 2015.
- [XML with Java, Java Servlet, and JSP](http://cs259.tv/2007/fall/) ((YouTube)[https://www.youtube.com/user/cscie259]), David Malan, CSCI E-259, Fall 2007, Harvard Extension School.

## In-depth introductions

Some people can learn languages by reading online tutorials. Some people like to dive into a book, or have one on their shelf for reference.

- [XQuery, 2nd Edition: Search Across a Variety of XML Data](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035589.do), Priscilla Walmsley, O'Reilly 2015. The standard text for XQuery, updated for XQuery 3.1. Also introduces [functx](http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/). Doesn't cover the topic of building applications with XQuery; this is out of scope.
- [eXist: A NoSQL Document Database and Application Platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026525.do), Erik Siegel and Adam Retter, 2014. If Walmsley is limited to the language, Siegel and Retter coherently introduce approaches to building applications with one popular XQuery-based platform, eXist. Example code for the book is [on GitHub](https://github.com/eXist-book/book-code).

## The specs

## More tutorials

- [XQuery Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery): An introduction to XQuery and a cookbook for various applications. Fairly eXist-centric and many pages out of date with developments both in eXist and XQuery, but very useful still.
- [XQuery and Lazy Enrichment](http://xquery.typepad.com/xquery/2007/08/xquery-and-lazy.html), Matt Turner, 2007. Demonstrates a simple but powerful technique for enriching text with links to Wikipedia. Easily applied to any XQuery implementation.
- [MarkLogic Server and Office 2007](https://developer.marklogic.com/blog/smallchanges/2009-01-22), Pete Aven, 2007-09. The last in a series (see the links to the other articles at the bottom) on how to open, manipulate, and create Microsoft Office documents using XQuery. Easily applied to any XQuery implementation.
